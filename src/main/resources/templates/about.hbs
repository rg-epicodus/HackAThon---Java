    Many people, especially women, believe that their financial well-being is linked solely to their ability to earn a high income. True financial independence, however, has much more to do with understanding and taking advantage of the finances you have. It's more about setting financial goals and learning to use financial strategies that will help you meet your objectives.

    My goal as a financial professional is to help you plan for financial security. Whether your goals involve building wealth through investing, funding a child's college education, planning for a comfortable retirement, or protecting your estate, I can help you develop a roadmap to reach your goals and make wise decisions to help improve your financial situation.

    The process I follow in completing a total financial strategy consists of:

    Gathering and analyzing your financial situation to develop a clear picture of your specific needs, assets, liabilities, and risk tolerance;
    Designing a financial strategy that takes into account the full range of needs you have now, and those needs you may have in the future; and
    Periodically reviewing your strategy, consulting with you to make appropriate adjustments, and assisting you in keeping your plan on track.
